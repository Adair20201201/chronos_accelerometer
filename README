This is an Open-Source library designed to make it easy to access accelerometer data from the TI EZ430-Chronos watch in any Java program. It was originally part of the CAGE program, developed by Michael O'Keefe and Eric Allen as part of work done through the Rensselaer Center for Open Source Software (RCOS). The CAGE project can be found at: http://github.com/epall/cage, and more information about the Rensselaer Center for Open Source Software can be found at http://rcos.cs.rpi.edu.
